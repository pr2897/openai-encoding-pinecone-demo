In many areas, the cost of living has
skyrocketed, while wages have stagnated, leaving many people unable to afford rent or
mortgages. This is particularly true in major cities like San Francisco and New York,
where the cost of living is much higher than the national average. As a result, many
people are forced to choose between paying for housing and other basic necessities
like food and healthcare. Additionally, the affordable housing that is available is
often in poor condition or located in unsafe neighborhoods, making it difficult for
people to secure stable housing.
