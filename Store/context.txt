Homelessness is a pervasive problem that affects millions of people worldwide.
In the United States alone, an estimated 580,000 people experience homelessness
on any given night, according to the National Alliance to End Homelessness. While
homelessness can affect anyone, certain populations are more vulnerable, such as veterans,
youth, and people experiencing mental health or substance abuse issues. The causes of
homelessness are complex and multifaceted, but can include a lack of affordable housing,
poverty, job loss, and systemic inequalities.  One of the primary causes of
homelessness is a lack of affordable housing.
