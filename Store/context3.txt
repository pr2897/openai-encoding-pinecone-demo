 Additionally, policies that address systemic inequalities and poverty, such as
raising the minimum wage and increasing access to healthcare and education, can help
to prevent people from becoming homeless in the first place.  Another key
strategy is to provide comprehensive support services to people experiencing
homelessness. This can include mental health and substance abuse treatment, job training and
employment services, and access to healthcare and other basic needs. By addressing the
underlying issues that contribute to homelessness, such as mental illness and poverty,
these services can help people to stabilize their lives and achieve long-term
housing stability.
